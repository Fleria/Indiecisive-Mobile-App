So many decisions, so little time. With indiecsive you can (finally) decide fast, without putting any thought into it! Use your camera to frame a group of objects, press "Choose" and let AR do the picking. Share your dilemmas and choice results with your friends!

## Concept
Indiecisive is a mobile application developed to assist in everyday dilemmas by lifting the burden of choice from the user. Through the mobile camera or manual typing, the application registers objects and makes a choice among them. It enables user sharing, has an NFC function, and keeps a record of previous logs through a database.
